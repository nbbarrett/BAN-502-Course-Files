## MLR Demo

Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
```

```{r}
college <- read.csv("College-1.csv")
glimpse(college)
```

We'll leave school as is - we actually use it in our modelling.  We may use "Type" which is currently a character type variable.  Let's use mutate to convert to a factor.

```{r}
college<- college %>% mutate(Type = as_factor(Type))
str(college)
```

Visualize relationships and look a correlation (note - Correlation not calculated for non-quantitative varables like "School" and "Type").  The variable we will ultimately try predict is "GradPercent".

```{r}
ggpairs(college,columns = c(2:7)) #exclude the 1st column which contains "Type"
```

Closer look at "Type" and "GradPercent".
```{r}
ggplot(college, aes(x= Type, y= GradPercent)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_bw()
```

Model

```{r}
mod1 <- lm(GradPercent ~ Type, college)
summary(mod1)
```

84.120 + (-1.787)*Type

Prediction by Type

```{r}
predict(mod1, newdata = data.frame(Type = c("Lib Arts", "University")))
```

An example with multiple levels in a categorical variable.

```{r}
flower = iris
str(flower)
```

Visualize/correlate
```{r}
ggpairs(flower)
```

Model (Species to predict Sepal.Length)

```{r}
mod2 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, flower)
summary(mod2)
```
5.0060 + 0.93*Versicolor + (1.582)(Virginica)


Prediction for virinica
```{r}
predict(mod2, newdata = data.frame(Species = c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica")))
```
